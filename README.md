# Project Overview: Payment Processing System

## Project Goal
The objective of this project is to develop a secure and scalable payment processing system that enables users to make transactions online using credit/debit cards, digital wallets, and bank transfers. The system will support features such as user authentication, transaction logging, fraud detection, and integration with third-party payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal.
The primary goal is to ensure high availability, data security, and compliance with financial regulations (e.g., PCI DSS). The platform will serve e-commerce platforms or SaaS products requiring seamless payment capabilities.

## Key Features
•	User registration and secure login (JWT-based authentication)
•	Payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal API)
•	Transaction history and invoicing
•	Webhooks to handle asynchronous payment confirmations
•	Admin dashboard for monitoring transactions and handling disputes
•	Basic fraud detection logic and rate limiting

## Tech Stack
•	Backend: Python (Django/Flask)
•	Database: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching
•	Authentication: JWT, OAuth2
•	Payment Integration: Stripe/PayPal SDK
•	DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Deployed on AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)
•	Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana
•	Security: HTTPS, input validation, environment variables for API keys

## Team Roles
### Backend Developer
### Primary Responsibility
Design, develop, and maintain the server-side logic, APIs, and integrations that power the core functionalities of the payment system.
### Key Tasks
•	Build secure APIs for payment processing, user management, and transaction handling.
•	Integrate with third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Flutterwave).
•	Implement business logic such as payment validation, fraud detection, and transaction status updates.
•	Ensure secure data handling using encryption and tokenization.
•	Optimize performance and scalability of backend services.
•	Collaborate with frontend developers to support smooth user experiences.

### Database Administrator (DBA) 
### Primary Responsibility
Manage and optimize the database systems that store user, transaction, and payment data, ensuring integrity, security, and availability.
### Key Tasks
•	Design robust, normalized database schemas for transaction-heavy workloads.
•	Maintain data accuracy and consistency across all systems.
•	Implement backup and disaster recovery solutions.
•	Monitor and tune database performance (indexes, queries, replication).
•	Enforce data access policies and handle sensitive data securely (e.g., PCI DSS compliance).
•	Support auditing and reporting needs for regulatory compliance.

## Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design
### 1. Users
•	Fields: user_id, name, email, password_hash, role
•	Users are central to the platform. They can be customers or property owners and are authenticated to perform transactions. Each user can list properties, make bookings, leave reviews, and make/receive payments.
### 2. Properties
•	Fields: property_id, owner_id (FK to Users), title, description, location, price_per_night
•	Properties are assets listed by users (hosts) for rent. Each property is linked to a user and can be booked by others. The data supports search, booking availability, and pricing.
### 3. Bookings
•	Fields: booking_id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), start_date, end_date, status
•	Bookings link users to properties for specific dates. They ensure availability, trigger payments, and generate transaction records. Each booking may result in a review and payment transaction.
### 4. Reviews
•	Fields: review_id, booking_id (FK), user_id (FK), rating, comment
•	Reviews provide feedback for both users and properties after a booking. They enhance trust and platform credibility. Reviews are tied to completed bookings only.
### 5. Payments
•	Fields: payment_id, booking_id (FK), user_id (FK), amount, status, timestamp
•	Payments ensure secure transfer of funds between guests and property owners. They are initiated upon successful booking. Each payment is tied to a booking and includes transaction verification data.

## Feature Breakdown
### User Management
This feature handles user registration, login, roles (guest or host), and profile updates. It underpins authentication and authorization throughout the platform. Secure user handling is critical for protecting accounts and transaction integrity.
### Property Management
Property management allows hosts to list, update, and remove rental units. It ensures accurate data for search and pricing. Integrated with availability and booking systems, it supports monetization of listings.
### Booking System
This enables users to reserve properties for specific dates. It ensures the property's availability, calculates cost, and triggers the payment process. It’s tightly coupled with property and user records.
### Reviews
Users leave ratings and comments after a stay. This drives trust, informs future renters, and motivates quality service. Reviews are stored per booking and moderated if needed.
### Payments
Handles secure money transfers, including booking payments, refunds, and fees. Payments are validated through third-party gateways. Ensuring security and accuracy in this system is vital for user trust.

## API Security
### Authentication
Verifies user identity (e.g., via JWT or OAuth). Prevents unauthorized access and session hijacking. Protects the entry point to the system.
### Authorization
Controls user permissions (e.g., only hosts can list properties). Prevents privilege escalation. Ensures users only perform allowed actions.
### Rate Limiting
Thwarts brute-force attacks and abuse of APIs. Critical for login endpoints and payment APIs. Enhances platform reliability and protects backend services.
### Protecting User Data
Sensitive data like emails, addresses, and payment info must be encrypted. Prevents identity theft and data breaches. Ensures GDPR/CCPA compliance.
### Securing Payments
Involves encryption, tokenization, and PCI DSS compliance. Prevents fraud and financial loss. Builds trust between platform and users.

## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is a development workflow where code changes are automatically tested, integrated, and deployed. In a payment project, CI/CD ensures that new features and security patches are quickly and safely delivered without downtime. It reduces human error, improves testing consistency, and keeps the platform reliable and scalable.

This project emphasizes clean architecture, modular design, and secure data handling to ensure maintainability and scalability in production environments.
