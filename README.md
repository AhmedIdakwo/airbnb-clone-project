# Project Overview: Payment Processing System

## Project Goal
The objective of this project is to develop a secure and scalable payment processing system that enables users to make transactions online using credit/debit cards, digital wallets, and bank transfers. The system will support features such as user authentication, transaction logging, fraud detection, and integration with third-party payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal.
The primary goal is to ensure high availability, data security, and compliance with financial regulations (e.g., PCI DSS). The platform will serve e-commerce platforms or SaaS products requiring seamless payment capabilities.

## Key Features
•	User registration and secure login (JWT-based authentication)
•	Payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal API)
•	Transaction history and invoicing
•	Webhooks to handle asynchronous payment confirmations
•	Admin dashboard for monitoring transactions and handling disputes
•	Basic fraud detection logic and rate limiting

## Tech Stack
•	Backend: Python (Django/Flask)
•	Database: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching
•	Authentication: JWT, OAuth2
•	Payment Integration: Stripe/PayPal SDK
•	DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Deployed on AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)
•	Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana
•	Security: HTTPS, input validation, environment variables for API keys

This project emphasizes clean architecture, modular design, and secure data handling to ensure maintainability and scalability in production environments.
